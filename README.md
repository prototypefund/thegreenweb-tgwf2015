# The Green Web Foundation Wordpress Theme

We've published this theme here to make it easier to update [The Green Web Foundation][1] website, both for people working inside the organisation, but also interested volunteers.

## Installation

If you want to make contributions, we assume you have a preferred way to work locally with wordpress.

This also assumes manage wordpress updates and and plugin installs outside the lifecycle of working on this theme.

You will likely need access to assets and sample database samples to set up a local environment like the existing site.

To do this, say hello in [the TGWF Zulip instance](https://gwf.zulipchat.com/join/i0onk87i70p50tsenx6ikgys/) to discuss getting access to these.
